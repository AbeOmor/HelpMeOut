# HelpMeOut
HelpMeOut allows any user to search for any kind of service and supplies the user with a list of students, student businesses and local businesses that can accomplish the task. The app will drastically reduce the time spent searching and allow an individual or group accomplish tasks faster. HelpMeOut provides a vast database of potential service providers and will be crowd sourced from multiple surveys via social media with students and local businesses.

HelpMeOut was a 2nd Year project, completed with Genevieve Okon,Jay Nguyen
